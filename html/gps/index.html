<section><p>Whether you are coding or writing the next vampire best-seller, you're likely to need certain short fragments of text again and again. Use snippets to save yourself tedious typing. Snippets are smart templates that will insert text for you and adapt it to their context.</p></section>

<section><p>To create a new snippet, select Tools | New Snippetâ€¦. Sublime Text will present you with an skeleton for a new snippet.
Snippets can be stored under any package's folder, but to keep it simple while you're learning, you can save them to your Packages/User folder.</p></section>

<!--
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	They define the different elements on the page that make it easier for yourself and future developers to understand as well as add accessability features.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	Requests data from the server. Server sends CSS, JS other files as defined by the HEAD tag and the DOM file is built and then rendered to the browser window.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	How to create snipets. Yes absolutely!
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	The use of the many semantic tags that I hadn't practiced with yet. I can gain understanding by practicing using them and viewing source code that is using them
