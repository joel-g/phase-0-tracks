What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
	The key philsophy of Linux is that the user is computer literate and knows what they are doing. It is in stark contrast to the Windows and Mac philosophy which is more along the lines of "shield the user from anything that might get them into trouble" or "computers are scary, please hide their complexity from the user". Another key design philosophy is that everything is open source. The entire Linux kernel is posted on Github.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
	Rather than using your own hardware to host a web server you can use a virtual or "cloud" server. One advantage is you don't have the start up costs of acquiring physical machines. You can also get on demand increases to speed and bandwith. You can also easily upgrade your virtual service by buying a better package when you traffic increases.


Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
	You can break things. Linux isn't really keen on warnings and it certainly won't stop the user from running amok since the core philsophy is after all "The user knows what they are doing"
