# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?: Version control allows multiple users to make contributions to a project. It protects the previous version of the project while allowing future merging of contributions from multiple users.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?: A branch isolates current changes being made from the master copy.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?: A commit is when a user submits changes to be synced to other users or the cloud. A good commit message is specific and succinct.
* What is a merge conflict?: A merge conflict occurs when multiple commits edit the same piece of code and Git doesn't know which version to use.
